The worst disability is procrastination and laziness
Tomorrow ain’t promised, why would you wait until tomorrow
Nobody believes in you, you’ve lost again and again and again, the lights are cut off, but you’re still looking at your dream, reviewing it everyday, and you say to yourself, it’s not over, until I win.
One day, the people that don’t even believe in you, will tell people how they met you.
Never put off to tomorrow what can be done today
The work you do while you procrastinate is the work you should be doing for the rest of your life
Courage is only the bravery to not run away
Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life
Even if I was walking on water, people would say that I can’t swim
To step toward your destiny you may have to step away from your security
Once you accept your flaws no one can use them against you
Don’t try to be better than everyone else, just be better than you were yesterday and do what you want to do.
If you do things that make you happy, you have no reason to be sad
Confidence is food for the wise and liquor for the foolish
Patience is bitter, but it’s fruit is sweet
Fear is the price of admission
It’s not about being a hero, it’s about not being a zero
A ship is always safe at shore, but that’s not what it’s built for
A man who never made a mistake never made anything
You’re never thankful for something until you don’t have it
In order to find a girlfriend you must find yourself
Burn some bridges, let the fire light the way
Sometimes you need to search across the world to find that what you’re looking for was right at home
No matter when you turn away from a loss, it’s profit
Stay close to people who feel like sunlight
The optimal line isn’t always the best line
